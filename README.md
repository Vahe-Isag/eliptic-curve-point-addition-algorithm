# eliptic-curve-point-addition-algorithm
An algorithm of point addition on an elliptic curve over a finite field using python
Using the algebraic formula for adding points, we create a Python algorithm. Point (x,y) is represented by a tuple (x, y) in Python, and the point O is represented by None. The main function here is add, which adds two points and returns the resulting point.
